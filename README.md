# LNDg UI

A very basic start for a LNDg UI, written in Angular 13 and ng-bootstrap 12.

## Quick start

1. Make sure you have node.js (v16), angular-cli and yarn installed
1. Run `yarn -D install`
1. Copy `.env.defaults` to `.env` and set your endpoint. 
1. Run `yarn start` to start a dev-server reachable at http://localhost:4200/

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
